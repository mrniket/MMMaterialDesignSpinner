                        I love Google's new indeterminate spinner in the [Material Design guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/progress-activity.html#progress-activity-types-of-indicators), and I hadn't found a recreation of it for iOS yet, so I created it using CoreGraphics and CoreAnimation, which makes it super lightweight, smooth, and scalable to large sizes.

                        Special thanks to the following projects and articles that helped me create this:
                        * [Google Material Design's Animated Loading Spinner Using HTML, CSS and SVG](http://david.ingledow.co.uk/blog/google-material-designs-animated-loading-spinner-svg-and-css/) for help figuring out exactly what animations were going on.
                        * [LLARingSpinnerView](https://github.com/lipka/LLARingSpinnerView) as the base for a custom activity spinner UIView.
                        * [center-vfl](https://github.com/evgenyneu/center-vfl) because centering things with Auto Layout's VFL is way harder than it should be to remember.
                        * [kylefox / color.m gist](https://gist.github.com/kylefox/1689973) for creating random UIColor values.
